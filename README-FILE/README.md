HTML & CSS COURSE ASSIGNMENT

Project Purpose
The aim of this assignment was to create a responsive website using a design we created in Figma and then developing the website in HTML and CSS only.

DESCRIPTION

In this project I have created a website for purchasing films to watch online. 

I created this website according to my design in the following figma file: https://www.figma.com/design/YNmCKo1BCxVOKKS1IuHsWV/Square-Eyes-Wireframe-Desktop-%2B-Mobile?node-id=0-1&t=d1FS2w7pf6UgjN67-0

The website contains:
- A home page with a banner and a carousel with upcoming films.
- A Films page with all the films listed at the top and then split into categories underneath. All the films are clickable. When clicking on a film you are redirected to another page with more information about the film and you have the option to buy the film or view the film trailer. When clicking on "Buy now", you are redirected to the cart page. When clicking on "view trailer" you are redirected to a film trailer. 
- An about page
- A contact page
- A cart page - it is not possible to view the films in the cart, as this was not part of the assignment. 



Project Brief 

I created this website according to the following brief:

- Certain functionality requiring JavaScript can be mimicked; for example, a login page could link across from the ‘Sign in’ button.
- The HTML should be semantic and neat.
- The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars.
- No frameworks
